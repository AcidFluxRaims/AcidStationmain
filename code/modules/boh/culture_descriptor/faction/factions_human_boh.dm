	description = "The Independent Marine Corps are former Solaran marines by and large, \
	recruited by and sworn to the command of the Independence, formerly Dagon. \
	The IMC ensures the safety of the ship, the crew, and performs away duties as heavier-armed escorts. \
	Generally better armed than they formerly were as SMC, the marine detachment aboard may also provide security in a pinch."
